abigailbarnes hw2 grade: 36/38
Graded revision 9

Graded by: GLK


question 1: finishing hw2.svg to match hw2.png
#1diff = 5/5 (matched appearance of given hw2.png image)
#1parts = 5/5 (2 lines, 1 rect, 1 ellipse, 1 (triangle) path)
looks like you opted to use "path" elements instead of "line" as requested,
but it ends up looking the same
#1format = 5/5 (conformed to stated geometry/color limits and to svg format)


question 2: find and describe a visualization
#2.1 = 1/1 (find/identify vis)
#2.2 = 5/5 (describe data variables)
  right - the nodes of the graph could be considered nominal, but the connections
  between them, which make graph data into a graph, don't fit within Stephens' scales
#2.3 = 2/2 (describe data source)
#2.4 = 4/5 (how are layout and encoding used)
  yes layout uses spatial proximity to show greater connectivity,
  but don't miss the basics: encoding uses tiny thumbnail images to show artist,
  and lines to show connections
#2.5 = 3/3 (what's the point)
#2.6 = 2/2 (successful?)
#2.7 = 4/5 (concision)
  over 350 words (discounting restatement of question); brevity matters
